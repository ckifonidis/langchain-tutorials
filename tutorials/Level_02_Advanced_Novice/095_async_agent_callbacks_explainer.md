# Async Agent Callbacks (095) with LangChain: Complete Guide

## Introduction

This implementation demonstrates a real-time financial transaction processing system by combining three key LangChain v3 concepts:
1. Agents: Manage transaction workflows
2. Async: Handle concurrent transaction processing
3. Callbacks: Trigger actions upon transaction completion

The system implements a scalable and efficient transaction management solution for banking applications, ensuring prompt and accurate processing.

### Real-World Application Value
- Efficient transaction processing
- Concurrent operations
- Real-time decision making
- Workflow monitoring
- Performance optimization

### System Architecture Overview
```
Transaction → AsyncTransactionProcessor → Agent Network
  ↓                ↓                      ↓
Request        Distribution          Processing
  ↓                ↓                      ↓
Roles           Messages             Completion
```

## Core LangChain Concepts

### 1. Agents
```python
agent = TransactionAgent(agent_id="agent_1", callback_manager=callback_manager, llm=llm)
agent.process_transaction(transaction)
```

Features:
- Workflow management
- Task execution
- Decision-making
- Collaboration

### 2. Async
```python
async def process_transactions(self, transactions: List[Transaction]) -> None:
    tasks = [agent.process_transaction(transaction) for agent, transaction in zip(self.agents, transactions)]
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

Benefits:
- Concurrent processing
- Scalability
- Performance optimization
- Real-time operations

### 3. Callbacks
```python
callback_manager.register_callback("transaction_completed", callback)
```

Advantages:
- Event-driven actions
- Workflow monitoring
- Real-time notifications
- System responsiveness

## Implementation Components

### 1. Transaction Model
```python
class Transaction(BaseModel):
    transaction_id: str = Field(description="Unique transaction identifier")
    amount: float = Field(description="Transaction amount")
    status: TransactionStatus = Field(description="Current transaction status")
```

Key elements:
- Unique identification
- Amount tracking
- Status management

### 2. Agent Processing
```python
async def process_transaction(self, transaction: Transaction) -> None:
    transaction.status = TransactionStatus.PROCESSING
    decision = await self.llm.ainvoke(messages)
    transaction.status = TransactionStatus.COMPLETED
```

Features:
- Status updates
- AI-driven decisions
- Task completion
- Error handling

### 3. Callback Management
```python
class TransactionCallbackManager(CallbackManager):
    def register_callback(self, event: str, callback: Any) -> None:
        self.callbacks[event].append(callback)
```

Capabilities:
- Event registration
- Callback triggering
- Workflow integration
- System monitoring

## Advanced Features

### 1. AI-Driven Decisions
```python
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a financial expert."),
    HumanMessage(content=f"Process transaction {transaction.transaction_id} with amount {transaction.amount}.")
]
decision = await self.llm.ainvoke(messages)
```

Implementation:
- AI expertise
- Decision support
- Contextual processing
- Real-time analysis

### 2. Concurrent Operations
```python
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

Features:
- Parallel execution
- Load balancing
- Resource optimization
- Performance enhancement

### 3. Real-Time Monitoring
```python
callback_manager.trigger_callback("transaction_completed", transaction)
```

Strategies:
- Event-driven updates
- Status tracking
- Workflow visibility
- System responsiveness

## Expected Output

### 1. Transaction Processing
```text
Processing transactions...
AI Decision for txn_001: Verify Transaction Details, Authentication and Authorization, Check Account Balance, Process the Payment, Record the Transaction, Confirmation and Notification, Reconciliation
Transaction txn_001 completed with status TransactionStatus.COMPLETED

AI Decision for txn_002: Verify Transaction Details, Check Account Information, Authorization, Compliance Check, Processing the Transaction, Confirmation, Record Keeping
Transaction txn_002 completed with status TransactionStatus.COMPLETED

AI Decision for txn_003: Verify Transaction Details, Authorization, Select Payment Method, Check Account Balance, Process the Transaction, Record the Transaction, Confirmation, Reconciliation, Notify Relevant Parties
Transaction txn_003 completed with status TransactionStatus.COMPLETED
```
