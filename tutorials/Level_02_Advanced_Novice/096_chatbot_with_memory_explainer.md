# Chatbot with Memory (096) with LangChain: Complete Guide

## Introduction

This implementation demonstrates a conversational AI system by combining three key LangChain v3 concepts:
1. Chat Models: Enable natural language interaction
2. Memory: Maintain conversation context
3. Retrieval: Access relevant information

The system implements a responsive and context-aware chatbot for customer support in banking applications.

### Real-World Application Value
- Natural language interaction
- Contextual understanding
- Information retrieval
- Customer support
- Banking assistance

## Core LangChain Concepts

### 1. Chat Models
```python
chat_model = AzureChatOpenAI(
    azure_deployment=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    openai_api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    temperature=0.5
)
```

Features:
- Natural language processing
- Response generation
- Interaction management
- Contextual understanding

### 2. Memory
```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.add_message(message)
```

Benefits:
- Context tracking
- Interaction history
- Decision support
- Experience learning

### 3. Retrieval
```python
retrieved_info = retriever.retrieve(query)
```

Advantages:
- Information access
- Contextual relevance
- Data integration
- Knowledge enhancement

## Implementation Components

### 1. Message Handling
```python
class Message(BaseModel):
    sender: str = Field(description="Sender of the message")
    content: str = Field(description="Content of the message")
```

Key elements:
- Sender identification
- Content management
- Interaction tracking

### 2. Response Generation
```python
async def generate_response(self, user_input: str) -> str:
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful banking assistant."),
        HumanMessage(content=user_input),
        SystemMessage(content=retrieved_info)
    ]
    response = await self.chat_model.ainvoke(messages)
    return response.content
```

Features:
- Prompt creation
- AI-driven responses
- Contextual processing
- Real-time interaction

### 3. Information Retrieval
```python
retrieved_info = self.retriever.retrieve(user_input)
```

Capabilities:
- Query handling
- Data access
- Contextual relevance
- Information integration

## Advanced Features

### 1. Contextual Interaction
```python
memory.add_message(message)
```

Implementation:
- Context tracking
- Interaction history
- Decision support
- Experience learning

### 2. Real-Time Response
```python
response = await self.chat_model.ainvoke(messages)
```

Features:
- AI-driven interaction
- Contextual processing
- Real-time feedback
- Dynamic responses

### 3. Information Access
```python
retrieved_info = self.retriever.retrieve(query)
```

Strategies:
- Data integration
- Contextual relevance
- Knowledge enhancement
- Information access

## Expected Output

### 1. User Interaction
```text
User: What is my account balance?
Chatbot: I'm sorry, but I can't access your personal account information. To check your account balance, you can use your bank's online banking platform, mobile app, or contact customer service directly.
```

### 2. Contextual Understanding
```text
User: Can you help me with a loan application?
Chatbot: Of course! I can guide you through the process of applying for a loan. Here are the general steps you should follow:

1. **Determine Your Needs:**
   - Decide on the type of loan you need (e.g., personal loan, auto loan, mortgage).
   - Calculate the amount you need to borrow.

2. **Check Your Credit Score:**
   - Your credit score will affect your eligibility and interest rates. You can check it through various online services or your bank.

3. **Gather Necessary Documents:**
   - Proof of identity (e.g., passport, driver's license).
   - Proof of income (e.g., pay stubs, tax returns).
   - Employment verification.
   - Bank statements.
   - Any other documents required by the lender.

4. **Research Lenders:**
   - Compare interest rates, terms, and conditions from different lenders.
   - Consider both traditional banks and online lenders.

5. **Pre-Qualification:**
   - Some lenders offer pre-qualification, which can give you an idea of your eligibility and potential loan terms without affecting your credit score.

6. **Submit Your Application:**
   - Complete the application form with accurate information.
   - Submit all required documents.

7. **Review Loan Offers:**
   - If approved, carefully review the loan offer, including interest rates, repayment terms, and any fees.

8. **Accept the Loan:**
   - If you agree with the terms, sign the loan agreement.
   - Make sure you understand the repayment schedule and conditions.

9. **Receive Funds:**
   - Once the loan is finalized, the funds will be disbursed to your account.

If you have specific questions or need help with any part of the process, feel free to ask!
