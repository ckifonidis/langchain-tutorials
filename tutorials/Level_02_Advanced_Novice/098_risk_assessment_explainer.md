# Risk Assessment (098) with LangChain: Complete Guide

## Introduction

This implementation demonstrates a risk assessment system by combining three key LangChain v3 concepts:
1. Evaluation: Assess risk levels
2. Retrieval: Access relevant risk data
3. Structured Output: Provide clear risk reports

The system provides comprehensive risk analysis and reporting for financial applications.

### Real-World Application Value
- Risk analysis and assessment
- Data-driven decision making
- Impact evaluation
- Investment guidance
- Financial reporting

### System Architecture Overview

Roles           Messages         Structured Report
```

## Core LangChain Concepts

### 1. Evaluation
```python
examples = [{"query": assessment.description, "answer": "Expected risk outcome"}]
predictions = [{"result": "Predicted risk outcome"}]
evaluation_results = self.eval_chain.evaluate(examples, predictions)
```

Benefits:
- Risk assessment
- Impact analysis
- Performance metrics
- Continuous improvement

### 2. Retrieval
```python
query_embedding = self.embeddings.embed_query(assessment.description)
docs_and_scores = self.vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score_by_vector(query_embedding, k=2)
```

Advantages:
- Information access
- Contextual relevance
- Data integration
- Knowledge enhancement

### 3. Structured Output
```python
return {
    "content": response.content,
    "risk_level": assessment.risk_level,
    "impact_score": str(assessment.impact_score)
}
```

Features:
- Clear reporting format
- Risk level categorization
- Impact quantification
- Decision support

## Implementation Components

### 1. Assessment Model
```python
class RiskAssessment(BaseModel):
    assessment_id: str = Field(description="Unique assessment identifier")
    description: str = Field(description="Assessment description")
    risk_level: str = Field(description="Risk level of the assessment")
    impact_score: float = Field(description="Impact score of the risk")
```

Key elements:
- Unique identification
- Description management
- Risk categorization
- Impact measurement

### 2. Assessment Process
```python
async def assess_risk(self, assessment: RiskAssessment) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Retrieve relevant risk data
    query_embedding = self.embeddings.embed_query(assessment.description)
    docs_and_scores = self.vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score_by_vector(query_embedding, k=2)
    
    # Evaluate risk
    examples = [{"query": assessment.description, "answer": "Expected risk outcome"}]
    predictions = [{"result": "Predicted risk outcome"}]
    evaluation_results = self.eval_chain.evaluate(examples, predictions)
    
    # Generate risk report
    messages = [...]
    response = await self.llm.ainvoke(messages)
    return {...}
```

Features:
- Data retrieval
- Risk evaluation
- AI-driven reporting
- Structured output

### 3. Document Store
```python
def create_document_store(embeddings: AzureOpenAIEmbeddings) -> FAISS:
    documents = [
        Document(
            page_content="Investing in volatile markets can lead to high risks...",
            metadata={"category": "investment", "risk": "high"}
        ),
        Document(
            page_content="Stable markets provide lower risks...",
            metadata={"category": "investment", "risk": "low"}
        )
    ]
```

Capabilities:
- Risk data storage
- Semantic search
- Metadata management
- Context preservation

## Expected Output

### 1. Risk Assessment Report
```text
Assessment: Investing in volatile markets
Risk Report: Based on analysis of market volatility and historical data...
Risk Level: High
Impact Score: 8.5
```

### 2. Investment Analysis
```text
Assessment: Investing in stable markets
Risk Report: Market analysis indicates lower risk with stable returns...
Risk Level: Low
Impact Score: 3.0
```
