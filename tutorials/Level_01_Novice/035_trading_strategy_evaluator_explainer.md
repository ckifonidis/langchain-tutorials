# Understanding the Trading Strategy Evaluator in LangChain

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building a trading strategy evaluator using LangChain! This example demonstrates how to combine evaluation capabilities with structured output parsing to create a sophisticated system for analyzing trading strategies. Let's explore every aspect of the implementation in detail.

## Complete Code Walkthrough

### 1. Required Imports and Environment Setup

At the beginning of our implementation, we import all necessary modules and set up our environment:

```python
import os
import json
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from datetime import datetime
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
```

Each import serves a specific purpose in our trading strategy evaluation system. The standard library imports handle core functionality:
- `os`: For environment variable management and system operations
- `json`: For serializing and deserializing trading strategy data
- `typing`: For type annotations that enhance code clarity and catch errors early
- `datetime`: For timestamping our analysis results

The specialty imports provide our analytical framework:
- `dotenv`: Manages sensitive configuration like API keys
- `pydantic`: Defines our data schemas and validates inputs
- `langchain` components: Handle model interaction and structured outputs

### 2. Environment Variables

```python
required_vars = [
    "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT",
    "AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME",
    "AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"
]
```

The environment variable check is crucial for our application's reliability. We verify all required Azure OpenAI credentials are available before proceeding. This early validation prevents cryptic errors that might occur later during execution.

### 3. Trading Metrics Schema

```python
class TradeMetrics(BaseModel):
    """Schema for trade performance metrics."""
    win_rate: float = Field(description="Percentage of winning trades")
    profit_factor: float = Field(description="Ratio of gross profits to gross losses")
    max_drawdown: float = Field(description="Maximum peak to trough decline")
    avg_win: float = Field(description="Average profit on winning trades")
    avg_loss: float = Field(description="Average loss on losing trades")
    risk_reward_ratio: float = Field(description="Ratio of average win to average loss")
```

The TradeMetrics class defines our core performance indicators. Each metric provides crucial insight:

Win Rate is a fundamental metric but should be considered alongside other factors. A strategy with a 70% win rate but large losses on losing trades could still be unprofitable.

Profit Factor divides total profits by total losses. A value of 2.0 means profits are twice the size of losses, indicating strong performance. Values below 1.0 indicate an unprofitable strategy.

Maximum Drawdown measures risk in terms of peak-to-trough decline. This is crucial for position sizing and risk management. A 20% drawdown requires a 25% gain to recover, while a 50% drawdown requires a 100% gain.

### 4. Strategy Analysis Schema

```python
class StrategyAnalysis(BaseModel):
    """Schema for comprehensive strategy analysis."""
    strategy_name: str = Field(description="Name of the trading strategy")
    time_period: str = Field(description="Analysis time period")
    metrics: TradeMetrics = Field(description="Performance metrics")
    strengths: List[str] = Field(description="Strategy strengths")
    weaknesses: List[str] = Field(description="Strategy weaknesses")
    risk_assessment: str = Field(description="Risk level assessment")
    recommendations: List[str] = Field(description="Improvement recommendations")
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)
```

This comprehensive schema captures both quantitative and qualitative aspects of strategy evaluation. The example configuration is particularly important:

```python
model_config = {
    "json_schema_extra": {
        "examples": [{
            "strategy_name": "Moving Average Crossover",
            "time_period": "Jan 2024 - Mar 2024",
            "metrics": {
                "win_rate": 65.5,
                "profit_factor": 1.8,
                "max_drawdown": 12.5,
                "avg_win": 250.0,
                "avg_loss": 150.0,
                "risk_reward_ratio": 1.67
            },
            "strengths": [
                "Consistent performance in trending markets",
                "Clear entry and exit signals"
            ],
            "weaknesses": [
                "Underperforms in ranging markets",
                "Multiple false signals in volatile conditions"
            ],
            "risk_assessment": "Medium",
            "recommendations": [
                "Add trend filter for ranging markets",
                "Implement volatility-based position sizing"
            ]
        }]
    }
}
```

This example helps the model understand the expected output format and provides a template for analysis.

### 5. Chat Model Creation

```python
def create_chat_model() -> AzureChatOpenAI:
    """Initialize the Azure ChatOpenAI model."""
    return AzureChatOpenAI(
        azure_deployment=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
        openai_api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
        azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
        api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
        temperature=0
    )
```

The chat model is initialized with temperature=0 for consistent outputs. This is crucial in financial analysis where we want deterministic, reliable evaluations.

### 6. Strategy Evaluation Function

```python
def evaluate_trading_strategy(
    chat_model: AzureChatOpenAI,
    parser: PydanticOutputParser,
    strategy_data: Dict
) -> StrategyAnalysis:
    """Evaluate a trading strategy using the provided data."""
    format_instructions = parser.get_format_instructions()
    
    system_text = (
        "You are a trading strategy analyst. Evaluate the provided strategy data "
        "and provide a comprehensive analysis.\n"
        "Respond with a JSON object that exactly follows the schema below "
        "(do not include any extra text):\n\n"
        f"{format_instructions}\n"
    )
```

The evaluation function now explicitly handles format instructions and message construction, providing several benefits:
- Clear schema communication to the model
- Explicit formatting requirements
- No extraneous text in responses
- Consistent output structure

### 7. Example Usage: Moving Average Strategy

```python
ma_strategy_data = {
    "strategy_name": "Moving Average Crossover",
    "time_period": "Jan 2024 - Mar 2024",
    "trades": {
        "total_trades": 100,
        "winning_trades": 65,
        "losing_trades": 35,
        "total_profit": 16250,
        "total_loss": 9000,
        "largest_drawdown": 12.5
    },
    "market_conditions": [
        "Strong trends in January",
        "Increased volatility in February",
        "Range-bound in March"
    ]
}
```

This example demonstrates analyzing a Moving Average Crossover strategy with comprehensive trade statistics and market context information.

### 8. Example Usage: Mean Reversion Strategy

```python
mr_strategy_data = {
    "strategy_name": "Mean Reversion RSI",
    "time_period": "Jan 2024 - Mar 2024",
    "trades": {
        "total_trades": 80,
        "winning_trades": 48,
        "losing_trades": 32,
        "total_profit": 12000,
        "total_loss": 8000,
        "largest_drawdown": 15.0
    },
    "market_conditions": [
        "High volatility periods",
        "Multiple market reversals",
        "Some trending periods"
    ]
}
```

The Mean Reversion strategy example shows how different approaches can be evaluated using the same framework. This strategy typically:
- Has higher win rates but smaller profit targets
- Performs better in ranging markets
- Requires careful risk management

### 9. Output Formatting

The output presentation is carefully structured for clarity:
```python
print(f"Name: {analysis.strategy_name}")
print(f"Period: {analysis.time_period}")
print(f"Win Rate: {analysis.metrics.win_rate:.1f}%")
print(f"Profit Factor: {analysis.metrics.profit_factor:.2f}")
```

Each metric is formatted with appropriate precision:
- Percentages to one decimal place
- Ratios to two decimal places
- Clear labeling of metrics
- Organized sections
