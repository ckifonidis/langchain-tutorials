# Understanding the Investment Profile Manager in LangChain

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building an investment profile management system using LangChain! This example demonstrates how to combine memory management with output parsing to create a sophisticated system for managing client investment profiles and generating personalized recommendations.

## Complete Code Walkthrough

Let's examine every component of the implementation in detail, understanding both the technical aspects and their practical applications in investment management.

### 1. Required Imports and Environment Setup

```python
import os
import json
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from datetime import datetime
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory
```

Our imports provide the foundation for the profile management system:

The standard library imports handle core operations:
- `os`: Manages environment variables and system operations
- `json`: Handles serialization of profile data and recommendations
- `typing`: Provides type hints for code clarity and validation
- `datetime`: Manages timestamps and review dates

The specialty imports create our investment framework:
- `dotenv`: Securely manages API credentials
- `pydantic`: Defines structured investment profiles
- `langchain` components: Handle memory, parsing, and model interaction

### 2. Risk Profile Schema

```python
class RiskProfile(BaseModel):
    """Schema for client risk profile."""
    risk_tolerance: str = Field(description="Risk tolerance level (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)")
    investment_horizon: str = Field(description="Investment time horizon")
    income_category: str = Field(description="Income level category")
    investment_experience: str = Field(description="Level of investment experience")
    financial_goals: List[str] = Field(description="List of financial goals")
    investment_restrictions: List[str] = Field(description="Investment restrictions or preferences")
```

The RiskProfile class defines the core components of a client's investment profile. Each field serves a specific purpose:

Risk Tolerance captures the client's comfort level with investment volatility. This is crucial for portfolio construction and typically falls into three main categories:
- Conservative: Emphasizes capital preservation
- Moderate: Balances growth and stability
- Aggressive: Focuses on maximum growth potential

Investment Horizon represents the client's time frame for investing. This directly influences asset allocation decisions:
- Short-term (0-3 years): More conservative allocation
- Medium-term (3-10 years): Balanced approach
- Long-term (10+ years): More aggressive growth focus

Investment Experience helps tailor recommendations and educational needs:
- Beginner: Needs more explanation and simpler products
- Intermediate: Understands basic concepts
- Advanced: Can handle complex strategies

### 3. Portfolio Recommendation Schema

```python
class PortfolioRecommendation(BaseModel):
    """Schema for portfolio recommendations."""
    asset_allocation: Dict[str, float] = Field(description="Recommended asset allocation percentages")
    suggested_products: List[Dict[str, str]] = Field(description="Suggested investment products")
    rebalancing_frequency: str = Field(description="Recommended rebalancing frequency")
    min_investment: float = Field(description="Minimum investment amount")
    risk_level: str = Field(description="Portfolio risk level")
    expected_return: float = Field(description="Expected annual return percentage")
```

This schema structures investment recommendations with important components:

Asset Allocation defines the portfolio's composition across different asset classes:
```python
"asset_allocation": {
    "stocks": 60.0,
    "bonds": 30.0,
    "cash": 5.0,
    "alternatives": 5.0
}
```

Suggested Products provides specific investment vehicles:
```python
"suggested_products": [
    {
        "type": "ETF",
        "category": "US Large Cap",
        "suggestion": "Total Market Index Fund"
    }
]
```

### 4. Investment Profile Integration

```python
class InvestmentProfile(BaseModel):
    """Schema for comprehensive investment profile."""
    client_id: str = Field(description="Unique client identifier")
    profile: RiskProfile = Field(description="Client's risk profile")
    recommendation: PortfolioRecommendation = Field(description="Portfolio recommendations")
    next_review_date: datetime = Field(description="Next profile review date")
    notes: List[str] = Field(description="Important notes about client preferences")
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.now)
```

This comprehensive schema combines risk profiling with recommendations. The example configuration demonstrates ideal formatting:

```python
model_config = {
    "json_schema_extra": {
        "examples": [{
            "client_id": "INV001",
            "profile": {
                "risk_tolerance": "Moderate",
                "investment_horizon": "5-10 years"
            },
            "recommendation": {
                "asset_allocation": {
                    "stocks": 60.0,
                    "bonds": 30.0
                }
            }
        }]
    }
}
```

### 5. Profile Management Function

```python
def update_investment_profile(
    chat_model: AzureChatOpenAI,
    parser: PydanticOutputParser,
    memory: ConversationSummaryMemory,
    client_data: Dict
) -> InvestmentProfile:
```

This function handles profile updates by:
1. Loading conversation history for context
2. Processing new client information
3. Generating updated recommendations
4. Maintaining client preferences

### 6. Example Usage

The code demonstrates two key scenarios:

```python
# New Client Profile
new_client_data = {
    "client_id": "INV001",
    "age": 35,
    "employment": "Technology Sector",
    "annual_income": 150000,
    "current_savings": 100000,
    "risk_preferences": "Moderate"
}

# Profile Update
update_data = {
    "client_id": "INV001",
    "profile_update": {
        "risk_tolerance": "Moderate-Aggressive",
        "financial_goals": [
            "Retirement planning",
            "Home purchase in 5 years"
        ]
    }
}
```
