# Understanding Few-Shot Prompting in LangChain

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on few-shot prompting in LangChain! Few-shot prompting is a powerful technique that helps improve model responses by providing example patterns. This tutorial will help you understand and implement effective few-shot prompting strategies.

## Core Concepts

1. **What is Few-Shot Prompting?**
   Think of it like teaching by example:
   
   - **Examples**: Showing the model correct question-answer pairs
   - **Pattern Learning**: Model learns from example patterns
   - **Consistency**: Helps maintain consistent response formats
   - **Context**: Provides clear context for the task

2. **Components**
   Key elements in few-shot prompting:
   
   - **Example Format**: How each example is structured
   - **System Message**: Overall instruction context
   - **Few-Shot Template**: Collection of examples
   - **Final Prompt**: Combining all elements

3. **Example Structure**
   ```python
   examples = [
       {
           "question": "What is the capital of France?",
           "answer": "The capital of France is Paris. This city serves as both the country's political and cultural center."
       },
       {
           "question": "What is the capital of Japan?",
           "answer": "The capital of Japan is Tokyo. This metropolitan city is the country's political, economic, and cultural hub."
       }
   ]
   ```

## Implementation Breakdown

1. **Creating Few-Shot Templates**
   ```python
   def create_few_shot_prompt(examples: List[Dict[str, str]]):
       # Define example format
       example_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
           ("human", "{question}"),
           ("assistant", "{answer}")
       ])
       
       # Create few-shot prompt
       few_shot_prompt = FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate(
           example_prompt=example_prompt,
           examples=examples
       )
       
       return few_shot_prompt
   ```
   
   Key aspects:
   - Example format definition
   - Template creation
   - Example integration

2. **Combining with System Instructions**
   ```python
   final_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
       ("system", "You are a helpful assistant that provides clear and informative answers about capital cities."),
       few_shot_prompt,
       ("human", "{question}")
   ])
   ```
   
   Features:
   - System context
   - Examples integration
   - Query format

3. **Using the Prompt**
   ```python
   # Format the prompt
   formatted_prompt = final_prompt.format_messages(question=question)
   
   # Get response
   response = model.invoke(formatted_prompt)
   ```
   
   Process:
   - Prompt formatting
   - Model invocation
   - Response handling

## Best Practices

1. **Example Selection**
   ```python
   # Good example set
   examples = [
       {
           "question": "What is the capital of France?",
           "answer": "The capital of France is Paris. This city serves as both the country's political and cultural center."
       },
       # More diverse examples...
   ]
   ```
   
   Tips:
   - Use diverse examples
   - Maintain consistent format
   - Include edge cases

2. **Format Guidance**
   ```python
   system_message = """You are a helpful assistant that provides answers about capital cities.
   Follow this format:
   1. Name of the capital
   2. Brief description
   3. One interesting fact"""
   ```
   
   Benefits:
   - Clear structure
   - Consistent responses
   - Predictable format

3. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   try:
       response = model.invoke(formatted_prompt)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Error: {str(e)}")
       # Handle error appropriately
   ```

## Example Output

When running `python 018_few_shot_prompting.py`, you'll see:

Example 1: Basic Few-Shot Pattern
--------------------------------------------------
Question: What is the capital of Italy?
Response: The capital of Italy is Rome. This historic city serves as both the country's political center and a cultural treasure trove.
--------------------------------------------------

Example 2: Few-Shot with Format Guidance
--------------------------------------------------
Question: What is the capital of Spain?
Response: 1. Madrid
2. A vibrant metropolitan city in central Spain
3. Madrid's Prado Museum houses one of the world's finest collections of European art
```

## Real-World Applications

1. **Standardized Responses**
   - Customer service replies
   - FAQ generation
   - Documentation writing

2. **Format Enforcement**
   - Report generation
   - Data extraction
   - Content summarization

3. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Teaching specific styles
   - Format adaptation
   - Pattern learning

## Common Patterns

1. **Basic Example Pattern**
   ```python
   # Simple question-answer pattern
   examples = [
       {"question": "Q", "answer": "A"},
       {"question": "Q2", "answer": "A2"}
   ]
   ```

2. **Structured Output**
   ```python
   # Format with specific sections
   examples = [
       {
           "question": "Q",
           "answer": """
           1. Main point
           2. Description
           3. Fact"""
       }
   ]
   ```
