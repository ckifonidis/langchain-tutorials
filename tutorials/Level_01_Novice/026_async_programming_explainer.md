# Understanding Async Programming in LangChain

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on async programming in LangChain! Async programming allows for concurrent operations, improving performance when dealing with multiple language model requests. This tutorial will help you understand how to implement and use async features effectively.

## Core Concepts

1. **What is Async Programming?**
   Think of it like multitasking:
   
   - **Concurrency**: Handle multiple operations simultaneously
   - **Non-blocking**: Continue work while waiting for responses
   - **Performance**: Improve throughput for multiple requests
   - **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of system resources

2. **Key Components**
   ```python
   import asyncio
   from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
   from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
   ```

3. **Basic Structure**
   ```python
   async def process_question_async(chain, question: str):
       """Process a question asynchronously."""
       return await chain.ainvoke({"question": question})
   
   # Running async code
   asyncio.run(main())
   ```

## Implementation Breakdown

1. **Async Function Definition**
   ```python
   async def process_questions_async(chain, questions: List[str]):
       tasks = [
           process_question_async(chain, question)
           for question in questions
       ]
       results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
       return results
   ```
   
   Features:
   - Task creation
   - Concurrent execution
   - Result gathering
   - Error handling

2. **Sync vs Async Comparison**
   ```python
   # Synchronous (Sequential)
   def process_questions_sync(chain, questions: List[str]):
       results = []
       for question in questions:
           response = chain.invoke({"question": question})
           results.append(response)
       return results
   
   # Asynchronous (Concurrent)
   async def process_questions_async(chain, questions: List[str]):
       tasks = [process_question_async(chain, q) for q in questions]
       return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
   ```
   
   Benefits:
   - Faster total execution
   - Better resource usage
   - Scalable processing
   - Improved throughput

3. **Result Tracking**
   ```python
   class QueryResult(BaseModel):
       question: str = Field(description="Original question")
       answer: str = Field(description="Model's response")
       time_taken: float = Field(description="Processing time")
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Configuration**
   ```python
   def create_chat_model():
       return AzureChatOpenAI(
           # ... configuration ...
           streaming=False  # Important for async
       )
   ```
   
   Tips:
   - Disable streaming for async
   - Configure timeouts
   - Handle rate limits
   - Manage resources

2. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   async def safe_process_question(chain, question: str):
       try:
           return await process_question_async(chain, question)
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Error processing question: {str(e)}")
           return None
   ```

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   ```python
   start_time = time.time()
   results = await process_questions_async(chain, questions)
   total_time = time.time() - start_time
   print(f"Total time: {total_time:.2f} seconds")
   ```

## Example Output

When running `python 026_async_programming.py`, you'll see:

```
Demonstrating LangChain Async Programming...

Example 1: Basic Sync vs Async Comparison
--------------------------------------------------
Processing synchronously...
Total sync time: 8.45 seconds

Processing asynchronously...
Total async time: 2.31 seconds

Example 2: Mixed Processing Times
--------------------------------------------------
Processing with varying delays...
Total time: 2.15 seconds
```

## Common Patterns

1. **Batch Processing**
   ```python
   async def process_batch(questions: List[str], batch_size: int = 5):
       for i in range(0, len(questions), batch_size):
           batch = questions[i:i + batch_size]
           results = await process_questions_async(chain, batch)
           yield results
   ```

2. **Progress Tracking**
   ```python
   async def track_progress(tasks):
       for task in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
           result = await task
           print(f"Completed: {result.question}")
   ```

## Performance Comparison

1. **Sequential vs Concurrent**
   ```plaintext
   Sequential Processing (4 questions):
   - Total Time: ~8 seconds
   - Per Question: ~2 seconds
   
   Concurrent Processing (4 questions):
   - Total Time: ~2.3 seconds
   - Per Question: ~2 seconds (but overlapped)
   ```

2. **Resource Usage**
   - CPU: Similar for both
   - Memory: Slightly higher for async
   - Network: More efficient with async
