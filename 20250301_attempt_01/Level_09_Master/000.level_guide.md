Level 9: Master
Focus: Complex Multi-Agent Systems and Robust Error Recovery

Topics:
Orchestrating multiple specialized agents
Hierarchical memory integration (buffer + summarization)
Advanced conditional branching and robust error handling
Example: A system where several agents collaborate to answer a complex query, each handling distinct subtasks and using dynamic memory.
