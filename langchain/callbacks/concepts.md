# Callbacks in LangChain

## Core Concepts

Callbacks provide hooks into various stages of LLM applications:

1. Basic Functionality
   - Event hooking
   - Application monitoring
   - Process tracking

2. Key Components
   - Callback handlers
   - Event system
   - Runtime integration

## Implementation Features

1. Callback Handlers
   - Custom handler creation
   - Event handling
   - Response processing

2. Event Types
   - LLM interactions
   - Chain operations
   - Tool executions

## Key Features

1. Monitoring Capabilities
   - Logging
   - Performance tracking
   - Streaming support

2. Integration Methods
   - Runtime callbacks
   - Nested object handling
   - Event propagation

## Best Practices

1. Handler Design:
   - Event selection
   - Response handling
   - Error management

2. Implementation Strategy:
   - Proper event hooking
   - Resource management
   - Error handling
